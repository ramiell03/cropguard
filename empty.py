SECTION A: MULTIPLE CHOICE (30 marks)

D. All of the aboveExplanation: System study includes analyzing the current system, documenting it, identifying weaknesses, and proposing improvements or new goals.

A. Structure chartExplanation: A structure chart is used in structured design to show the hierarchical structure of system modules.

C. Phased ConversionExplanation: In phased conversion, one module of the new system is implemented at a time to minimize risk.

A. An algorithmExplanation: Algorithms are step-by-step instructions used to solve specific problems.

C. to identify a top-level function and then create a hierarchy of lower-level modules and componentsExplanation: Top-down design starts with high-level functions and breaks them down into smaller parts.

A. size of the companyExplanation: The size of a company does not directly contribute to system development failure.

A. InputExplanation: Inputs are the data needed for the system to generate the required outputs.

C. maintenance and signalExplanation: Inputs are typically classified as maintenance (support the system) and signal (activate the system).

A. at every stageExplanation: Documentation is essential throughout the system development lifecycle.

D. All of the aboveExplanation: Implementation includes system checkouts, pilot runs, and parallel operations.

C. parallelExplanation: Parallel implementation runs both the old and new systems simultaneously to reduce risks.

A. transposition errorExplanation: A transposition error occurs when digits are swapped during data entry.

D. All of the aboveExplanation: Decision trees depict alternate conditions, use nodes and branches, and show consequences.

B. systems analysis phaseExplanation: Problem analysis is a key part of the system analysis phase.

A. actionsExplanation: Decision tables link conditions to actions that must be taken.

D. All of the aboveExplanation: Department reps act as users, liaisons, and information sources on a feasibility committee.

A. System Development Life CycleExplanation: SDLC is a structured process used to develop information systems.

B. reviewExplanation: A system review is an appraisal conducted after system implementation.

A. identification of business processes that are the essence of the businessExplanation: Understanding business processes is the foundation for MIS development.

C. Telemetry is the process of recording the behaviour of your systems.Explanation: Telemetry involves collecting and transmitting data from systems for monitoring purposes.

SECTION B: STRUCTURAL QUESTIONS (30 marks)

Definitions:

SCM (Software Configuration Management): A discipline for systematically controlling changes in software.

Baseline: A reference point in the development process that is formally reviewed and agreed upon.

Configuration items: Components that are part of the software configuration and subject to change control.

Software development: The process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, and testing applications.

Three Levels of Tool Usage:

Informational: Tools are used for browsing, searching, and static documentation.

Interactive: Tools assist users in performing tasks such as code editing and debugging.

Integrated: Tools are linked together, supporting automatic transitions and data sharing (e.g., IDEs).

Organizational Entities Involved:

Developers: Use tools to write, test, and debug code.

Management: Use tools for tracking progress and ensuring quality.

Customers/Clients: May use tools for feedback, requirements, or acceptance testing.

Software Development Methodologies:
i. Agile: Iterative and incremental development methodology. Tools: Jira, Trello

ii. DevOps: Combines software development and IT operations. Tools: Jenkins, Docker

Essential Development Tools:
i. Build tools: Compile source code into executable software. Examples: Maven, Gradle

ii. CI/CD tools: Automate integration and deployment. Examples: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD

Four AI Tools for Developers:

GitHub Copilot

Tabnine

CodeT5

Amazon CodeWhisperer

SECTION C: CASE STUDY (20 marks)

catWhiteSpace Testing
a) Type of test: Unit testing

b) Tools: JUnit, Mockito

c) Testing partitions and test cases:

Empty string -> Expect ""

String with single spaces -> Expect same string

String with multiple spaces -> Collapse to single space ("a  b   c" -> "a b c")

Leading/trailing spaces -> Remove extra spaces ("  a b  " -> " a b ")

Maintainability in Offshore Software
a) Stage: Maintenance phase

b) Tools for web application: SonarQube, Lighthouse

c) Program setup:

Log changes and bugs over time.

Use static analysis tools to measure code quality.

Collect metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, code churn, number of defects.

Analyze historical trends and identify common maintainability issues.

Train developers using findings to improve maintainability practices.
